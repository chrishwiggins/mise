# from @carr2n:
# explore:
- Don’t just do what you’re good at. Get outside of your comfort zone. Being a {scientist} is permission for lifetime learning.
# exploit:
- Do the work.
#- Someone who is underestimated will be the one who changes the world. It’s not the person everyone expects. It might be you.
#- “Do what is front of you.” Focus on the small steps ahead of you.
#- Don’t worry about achieving a master plan, about the plot to take over the world.
#- Be a worker among workers. It’s more important that you fit in before you stick out.
#- Follow the “Mom Rule.” Don’t do anything you couldn’t explain or justify to your mom.
- Be present. Don’t worry about documenting the moment with your smartphone. Experience it yourself.
- Take responsibility for the good and the bad. Learn to own your failures.
- Be honest, and be willing to have the difficult conversation.
- Don’t be afraid to be ambitious. It’s not a crime.

If you are cutting, shaping or doing other measured work, measure dimensions twice as often as you need to. When you go to the lavatory, spend a longer time there than is necessary. Forget tools so that you will have to go back after them. -- "Sabotage", 1944
# 11.d.3) Even if you understand the language, pretend not to understand instructions in a foreign tongue. -- "Sabotage", 1944
# 11.d.4) Pretend that instructions are hard to understand, and ask to have them repeated more than once. Or pretend that you are particularly anxious to do your work, and pester the foreman with unnecessary questions. -- "Sabotage", 1944
# 11.d.5) Do your work poorly and blame it on bad tools, machinery, or equipment. Complain that these things are preventing you from doing your job right. -- "Sabotage", 1944
