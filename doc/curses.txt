##- Be a worker among workers. It’s more important that you fit in before you stick out.
##- Follow the “Mom Rule.” Don’t do anything you couldn’t explain or justify to your mom.
#- Be present. Don’t worry about documenting the moment with your smartphone. Experience it yourself.
#- Take responsibility for the good and the bad. Learn to own your failures.
#- Be honest, and be willing to have the difficult conversation.
