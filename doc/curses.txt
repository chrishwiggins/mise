#- Choose.
- Prioritize done over better.
- Prioritize presence over toggling.
#- Someone who is underestimated will be the one who changes the world. It’s not the person everyone expects. It might be you.
- “Do what is front of you.” Focus on the small steps ahead of you.
#- Don’t worry about achieving a master plan, about the plot to take over the world.
#- Be a worker among workers. It’s more important that you fit in before you stick out.
#- Follow the “Mom Rule.” Don’t do anything you couldn’t explain or justify to your mom.
#- Don’t just do what you’re good at. Get outside of your comfort zone. Being a {scientist} is permission for lifetime learning.
#- Be present. Don’t worry about documenting the moment with your smartphone. Experience it yourself.
#- Take responsibility for the good and the bad. Learn to own your failures.
#- Be honest, and be willing to have the difficult conversation.
#- Don’t be afraid to be ambitious. It’s not a crime.
#- Do the work.
#- The answer is never in the computer.
#- The prize is the pleasure of finding the thing out, the kick in the discovery, the observation that other people use it -- those are the real things.
#- Leap, and the net will appear.
- don't be silly.
